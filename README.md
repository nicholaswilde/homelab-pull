# Homelab Pull

An [ansible-pull][1] repo for my homelab.

---

## :framed_picture: Background

I'm currently using [ansible][3] to push configurations to my homelab containers via SSH. See my [Homelab Playbooks][5] repo.

This repo is meant to be a test of using GitOps, similar to Flux, to configure my homelab. Pros of this method are discussed in this [Learn Linux TV video][4].
